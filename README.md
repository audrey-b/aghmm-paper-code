# Approximate Marginal Likelihood Inference in Mixed Models for Grouped Data
Replication code for paper: *Approximate Marginal Likelihood Inference in Mixed Models for Grouped Data* by Alex Stringer.
All code was run on a 2021 M1 MacBook Pro with 10 cores and 64Gb of RAM. I did not test it on other hardware,
but I don't make use of any speciifc features of the Apple silicon either.

All scripts require the `aghqmm` package, available from GitHub [here](https://github.com/awstringer1/aghqmm).
You should download this repository to a directory on your machine.

Instructions to replicate all analyses in the paper as follows:

- Section 4.3, simulation 1:
  - In the script `01-simulations-absolute.R`, look for several `CHANGE` comments on lines 7-21. Change the paths here to whatever you like.
  - In partcular, make sure you tell the script where to find the `aghqmm` package.
  - Run the script `01-simulations-absolute.R`.
  - In the script `01-summarize-simulations-absolute.R`, look for `CHANGE` comments on lines 8 and 14. Change the paths here to whatever you chose in the previous script.
  - Run the script `01-summarize-simulations-absolute.R`.
- Section 4.3, simulation 2:
- Section 5.1, smoking data:
- Section 5.2, toenail data:
- Supplement 3.1:
- Supplement 3.2.1:
- Supplement 3.2.2:
- Supplement 3.3:
- Supplement 4.1:
- Supplement 4.2:

The data are obtained as follows:

- **Smoking**: obtained from the online supplementary material to the paper *A note on marginalization of regression parameters from mixed models of binary outcomes* by Donald Hedeker, Stephen H. C. du Toit, Hakan Demirtas, and Robert D. Gibbons (*Biometrics* (2017) **74**(1) pp. 354â€“361). Find that paper [here](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/biom.12707). Data set is **Smoking.dat**.
- **Toenail**: data set `toenail` in `R` package `mice`.
