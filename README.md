# Approximate Marginal Likelihood Inference in Mixed Models for Grouped Data
Replication code for paper: *Approximate Marginal Likelihood Inference in Mixed Models for Grouped Data* by Alex Stringer.
Instructions to replicate all analyses in the paper as follows:

- Section 4.3, simulation 1:
- Section 4.3, simulation 2:
- Section 5.1, smoking data:
- Section 5.2, toenail data:
- Supplement 3.1:
- Supplement 3.2.1:
- Supplement 3.2.2:
- Supplement 3.3:
- Supplement 4.1:
- Supplement 4.2:

The data are obtained as follows:

- **Smoking**: obtained from the online supplementary material to the paper *A note on marginalization of regression parameters from mixed models of binary outcomes* by Donald Hedeker, Stephen H. C. du Toit, Hakan Demirtas, and Robert D. Gibbons (*Biometrics* (2017) **74**(1) pp. 354â€“361). Find that paper [here](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/biom.12707). Data set is **Smoking.dat**.
- **Toenail**: data set `toenail` in `R` package `mice`.
